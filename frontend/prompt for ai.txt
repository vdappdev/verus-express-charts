I'm working on a Verus blockchain charting project that displays trading pair data using TradingView's Lightweight Charts library. Current status:

Working features:
- Frontend HTML/JavaScript setup (port 5273)
- Express backend (port 5500)
- API endpoints working correctly
- UI controls working:
  - Basket currency selection (Pure, Bridge.vETH)
  - Currency pair selection (numerator/denominator)
  - Interval selection (1440, 10080 blocks)
  - Volume currency selection
- Data fetching and transformation working correctly

Current Problem:
The API is returning correct OHLCV data for trading pairs (confirmed via console logs), but the chart isn't rendering. Specifically:
- Data transformation is successful (verified in console)
- No console errors
- Chart container exists but remains empty
- Using TradingView Lightweight Charts library via CDN:
  `https://unpkg.com/lightweight-charts/dist/lightweight-charts.standalone.production.js`
- Data format matches TradingView requirements:
  ```javascript
  {
    time: blockHeight,
    open: value,
    high: value,
    low: value,
    close: value,
    volume: value
  }
Latest console output shows successful data transformation with 55 valid OHLCV data points, but no visual rendering.

Relevant code files:

index.html (chart container and UI)
app.js (chart initialization and data handling)
styles.css (if needed)
Need help debugging why the chart isn't rendering despite having valid data and proper initialization.
