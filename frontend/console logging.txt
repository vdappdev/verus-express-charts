This sounds like a data consistency/transformation issue since some pairs work and others don't. Let's debug this systematically:

For the non-working pairs (like tbtc.veth/vrsc):

Can you log the exact data structure before it's passed to the chart?
Are there any null/undefined values in the OHLCV data?
Are the values extremely small or large (might need scaling)?
Are there gaps in the data that might affect rendering?

For bridge.veth pairs not returning data:

Is the API endpoint returning different data structures for different currency types?
Could there be case sensitivity issues in the currency names?
Are there any specific conditions in your backend that might filter out or transform bridge.veth data differently?

For pairs that work (vrsc/tbtc.veth, vrsc/pure):

What's unique about their data structure?
Are the numerical values in a different range?
Is the data more consistent/complete?

Could you share:

A console.log of a working pair's data
A console.log of a non-working pair's data
The API response for a bridge.veth pair
This would help identify patterns in what makes some pairs work while others don't.
